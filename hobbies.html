    <h3>Favorite Things To Do</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Musique</strong>: As briefly mentioned earlier, I am an artist at heart. I love composing and singing songs in my spare time. Whether it's in the shower or at church, singing is one of the activity I enjoy the most.</li>
    <li> <strong>Learning</strong>: One of my personal goal is to constantly improve. I tend to get bored at times and acquiring new skills and information whether is career related or self-improvement is crucial for me. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment and showcase my strengths and weaknesses in areas I am working on.</li>
    <li> <strong>Adventure</strong>: The world we live in is so diverse! Being able to travel and explore new places, cultures, values, arts and cuisines is I must say an incredible thing to do.</li>
