    <h1>Hello! My name is Nohemi Djebou</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my page! I am honored to be part of <a href="https://perscholas.org/"> Per Scholas </a>2022 11 Rtt Group.</h2>
    <p> I have a background in <strong>Business Administration</strong> and <strong>Marketing</strong>. In my spare time I compose songs and love to sing. What has appealed to me the most about envisioning a career in IT is the possibility of constantly evolving and improving. My aim is not only to become a successful software engineer but also to be able to create and innovate in the IT field.</p>
    <p><em> Fun Fact about me: I spent a major part of my childhood travelling with my parents and speak three different languages. I love to explore new cuisines. Have you heard of the word <a href="https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_escargots-au-beurre-persille_25188.aspx"> 'Escargot' </a>? It's a French delicacy composed of cooked snails. If you are adventurous like me, you should try it. It's delicious!</em></p>
